# Prediabetes Risk Calculator – Educational Methodology

This repository documents the educational methodology and references
behind a non-diagnostic prediabetes risk awareness tool.

The project is intended to help individuals understand how commonly
recognized factors — such as age, body size, waist circumference,
physical activity, family history, blood pressure status, and optional
laboratory values — may combine to influence long-term metabolic risk.

## Purpose

This tool is designed for preventive health education only.
It does not diagnose disease and does not replace professional
medical advice or clinical evaluation.

## Methodology Overview

Risk estimation is based on a point-based model informed by
population-level risk factors described in public health and
diabetes prevention literature.

Individual inputs are combined into a normalized index (0–100)
to provide an intuitive overview of relative risk rather than
an absolute probability.

## Limitations

This methodology does not account for all possible genetic,
medical, or environmental factors. Individual risk may vary
substantially. Diagnostic decisions require appropriate
laboratory testing and professional evaluation.

## Educational Resource
